# CircleDraw

(First Read Me cut me some slack)
CircleDraw is an iOS interactive SwiftUI app that allows users to build a dynamic and colorful canvas of forms using touch interactions. To provide an engaging user experience, the app makes use of numerous SwiftUI views and state management approaches.

## Features
Dynamic Canvas: Users may build circles with custom colors and sizes by tapping on the screen.
Color Selection: Select a color (Red, Green, Blue, or Orange) to apply to the new forms.
Size Adjustment: A slider allows the user to change the size of the newly created circles.
Undo Functionality: Includes a button for undoing the previous action. This is not a standard Undo feature.
Clear Canvas: A button that clears the canvas of all forms.

## Components
primary: The application's primary view, which includes the dynamic canvas and toolset.
Location: A struct containing the size, color, and position of each touch location.
ColorButtonView: A view that has buttons for changing the color of the following shapes.
Tools: A view that includes the undo, redo, and clear functions.
